This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and you try to render an item with a null or undefined value.  It happens when your data source contains null or undefined elements, and the component tries to access properties of these null/undefined values, leading to a TypeError.  The error message itself might vary slightly depending on the specific property being accessed.
